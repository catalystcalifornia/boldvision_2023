# About the Data 

The Bold Vision report measures 19 indicators from five different domains to wholistically gather the state of youth in Los Angeles County. The selection of Bold Visionâ€™s indicators was guided by an intentional and iterative process with research experts, community-based organizations, and youth prior to the launch report. We analyze these indicators and their respective domains to track how all youth are supported in reaching their fullest potential and the degree of disparity between groups in L.A. County. Each indicator is processed by race group and regional group. Additionaly, an index of disparity calculation allows us to see how youth in varying groups compare against one another, this highlights the disparities amidst youth. See below each domain and the indicator associated: 
__Systems Impact__
* Graduation Rates of Systems-Impacted Youth
* Youth Arrests
* Youth Diverted from Arrests
* Youth affected by Immigration Systems (Undocumented)
* Youth in Foster Care or Probation
__Healthy Built Environment__
* Lack of Green Space
* Pollution Exposure around Sensitive Land Uses
* Traffic Fatalities/Injuries
* Rent Burden
* Access to Fresh Fruits and Vegetables
__Positive Youth Development__
* Asthma Rates
* Good/Excellent Health Status
* Access to Needed Medical Care
* Connected Youth

__Youth Power__
