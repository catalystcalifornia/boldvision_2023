# About the Project

[Bold Vision](https://www.boldvisionla.org/) is a multi-sector, 10-year-plus initiative that aims to fundamentally improve the lives of BIPOC children and youth, creating lasting change in our communities by establishing new paths towards success for young people across Los Angeles County. Thanks to decades of power-building, Los Angeles is reaching a tipping point. This tipping point is an opportunity for youth of color and allies to eliminate existing inequities and transform public systems into ones of support, not suppression. The task before us is to follow the lead of youth of color, and commit to the investments, advocacy, and power-building needed to finally uproot inequities from our public systems. 

Data is a vital tool to measure how youth of color are thriving, or lacking the resources and guidance necessary to reaching their fullest potential. Bold Vision released it's first data-driven report measuring how well youth are thriving across Los Angeles in 2022. This prior report can be viewed at the bottom of this webpage [here](https://www.boldvisionla.org/issue/). This year in 2024, the indicator report has been updated with the latest data available and with new indicators across the five domains of interest: Positive Youth Development, Healthy Built Environment, Systems Impact, Youth Power, and Community Organizing and Power-Building. See the updated indicator report [here](https://www.boldvisionla.org/). 

# Acknowledgement and Partners

# About the Data 

## Indicators Overview
The Bold Vision report measures nineteen indicators from five different domains to wholistically gather the state of youth in LA County. The selection of Bold Vision’s indicators was guided by an intentional and iterative process with research experts, community-based organizations, and youth prior to the launch report. We analyze these indicators and their respective domains to track how all youth are supported in reaching their fullest potential and the degree of disparity between groups in LA County. Each indicator is processed by race group and regional group (region is mostly defined by LA County Service Planning Areas, SPAs). Additionaly, an index of disparity calculation allows us to see how youth in varying groups compare and it reveals the disparities amidst youth. See below for each domain and its associated indicators: 

| Domain                         | Description    | Indicators                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Systems Impact | In any youth’s life, there are events that can throw them off track. But the systems that respond to crisis points for youth of color must center their well-being. | Systems Impact Index of Disparity by Subgroup and SPA, Graduation Rates of Systems-Impacted Youth, Youth Arrests, Youth Diverted from Arrests, Youth affected by Immigration Systems (Undocumented), Youth in Foster Care or Probation |
| Healthy Built Environment | For youth of color to thrive, they need to live, learn, and play in thriving resource rich environments. | Healthy Built Environment Index of Disparity by Subgroup and SPA, Lack of Green Space, Pollution Exposure around Sensitive Land Uses, Traffic Injuries/Fatalities, Rent Burden, Access to Fresh Fruits and Vegetables |           
| Positive Youth Development | Positive youth development encompasses several distinct spheres: education, leadership development, employment in a career, and the physical and mental health supports youth of color need to develop into thriving adults. | Positive Youth Development Index of Disparity by Subgroup and SPA, Asthma Rates, Good/Excellent Health Status, Access to Needed Medical Care, Connected Youth, Early Childhood Education Access | 
| Youth Power | Youth of color are the ones most familiar with the challenges, hopes, and opportunities that confront them – and so, the more they can have a presence in public decision-making, the closer we will be to solutions for youth. | Youth Power Index of Disparity by Subgroup and SPA, Youth Receiving a Living Wage, Access to Base-Building Organizations, Politically Engaged Youth, Youth Voter Turnout |
| Community Organizing and Power Building | Over the past decade, Los Angeles’s youth of color and adult allies have built a strong ecosystem of community organizations in recognition that the right research and the right policy by themselves are not sufficient to achieve change: indeed, the only true pre-requisite for transformation is organized community power. | Average Budget of Base-Building and Social Advocacy Organizations, Tenure of Base-Building and Social Advocacy Organizations |

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

We completed the data cleaning, analysis, and visualization using the following software. 
* [R](https://cran.rstudio.com/)
* [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop)
* [ArcGIS](https://www.arcgis.com/index.html)

We used several R packages to analyze data and perform different functions, including the following.
* dplyr
* sf
* tidyr
* usethis
* leaflet
* RPostgreSQL
* readxl
* stringr
* rpostgis
* ggplot


```
list.of.packages <- c("usethis","dplyr","data.table", "sf", tidyr","RPostgreSQL","readxl","stringr","sf", "ggplot2", "flextable", "ggchicklet")
new.packages <- list.of.packages[!(list.of.packages %in% installed.packages()[,"Package"])]
if(length(new.packages)) install.packages(new.packages)

devtools::install_github("r-lib/usethis")

library(usethis)
library(dplyr)
library(sf)
library(tidyr)
library(RPostgreSQL)
library(readxl)
library(stringr)
library(sf)
library(ggplot2)
library(flextable)
